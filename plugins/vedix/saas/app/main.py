"""FastAPI entrypoint for vedix.ai SaaS.

Wires routers (jobs, mcp_proxy, webhooks), a lifespan that boots the
SQLAlchemy schema for in-process tests, and a minimal ``/healthz``
endpoint. The orchestrator pipeline is *not* imported at module load:
it's loaded lazily by ``workers/job_worker.py`` so unit tests for the
FastAPI plumbing don't require the full plugin tree.
